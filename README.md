As spinal cord images acquired at 7T usually present with higher spatial resolution, new details, different contrasts and artifacts, the model was trained to refine white matter /gray matter segmentation.


The model was trained in the Center for Magnetic Resonance in Biology and Medicine (CRMBM-CEMEREM, UMR 7339, CNRS, Aix-Marseille University - France, using [ivadomed](http://ivadomed.org/). It relies on high-resolution(0.175 x 0.175 mm2) 7T T2*-weighted images from [CRMBM-CEMEREM](https://crmbm.univ-amu.fr/topic/spinal-cord-imaging/) acquired on healthy and pathological subjects (multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). 

The convolutional neural network segments the spinal cord (SC) and the gray matter (GM) using 2D U-Net and this model was implemented in [SCT](https://spinalcordtoolbox.com/) as *gm_sc_7t_t2star* tool.
